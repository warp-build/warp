# Supported Platforms

Warp requires a bit of knowledge about a language
ecosystem before it can be really useful. This knowledge
is usually a series of [Rules](/docs/learn-warp/rules) and
usually an [Analyzer](/docs/learn-warp/analyzer).

To learn more about how Warp works, check out [Learning Warp](/docs/learn-warp).
