# Contributing to :zap: Zap

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :heart::tada::+1:

## Getting started

Zap is built with Rust, so you need the Rust toolchain to work on it. You can
get it here: https://rustup.rs

The `stable` toolchain should be enough.

You can then build and bootstrap the system by running:

```sh
zap $ make build
zap $ make test
zap $ make install
```
