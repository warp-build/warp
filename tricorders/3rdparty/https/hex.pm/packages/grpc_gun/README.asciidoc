= Gun

Gun is an Erlang HTTP client with support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket.

== Goals

Gun aims to provide an *easy to use* client compatible with
HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and Websocket. Gun can connect through any
combination of Socks and HTTP proxies.

Gun is *always connected*. It will maintain a permanent
connection to the server, reopening it as soon as the server
closes it, saving time for the requests that come in.

All connections are *supervised* automatically, allowing
developers to focus on writing their code without worrying.
