# Supported Platforms

This is a living document that reflects the current state of support for
specific platforms (like the Erlang programming language) and tools (like git).

Warps aims to, over time, add support for multiple platforms and programming languages, meaning you can comfortably orchestrate polyglot monorepos using only one tool. If you want to contribute to adding support for any platform check out our [contributions guidelines](references/contributing/)
