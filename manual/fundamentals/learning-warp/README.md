# ðŸ”­ Learning Warp

Tricorders, Signatures, Targets, and Rules. All of this and more makes up the vocabulary that we use to talk about Warp, and the abstractions we choose to make your builds and tests safe and fast.

Warp is split into 3 big sections:

1. An extensible static analysis platform
2. A flexible build configuration language
3. An incremental execution and content-addressable caching engine
