## Why Warp?

⚡️ **Faster-than-light.** Never do any work twice. Always get incremental build and test feedback within milliseconds.

🤝 **Built for teams.** Share every build and test artifact with your entire team. 

💰 **Save on CI.** Speed up your CI pipelines 100x.

🍰 **No setup, no hassle.** All build configuration is derived from sources and other tools config files.&#x20;

🧰 **Adaptable by default.** Use ecosystem best practices or customize the build to suit your needs.

📦 **Same build, everywhere.** Run the exact same builds and tests, byte-by-byte, locally and on CI.
