## ‚ö°Ô∏è Zero Configuration Builds

Warp enables **fully zero-config builds**. This is made possible through a concept we're calling Warp Signatures (üññ). 

A Warp Signature is a unique recipe for building a piece of source code at a point in time, that can be derived statically from analyzing the repository, and is updated automatically as the file changes.

Since warps build engine is fully deterministic we can ensure that every project is built **exactly** the same every time, on every machine.

Onboarding a new engineer becomes as simple as running a couple of warp commans.

```console
warp setup
warp build
```

And off you go, ensign, you're onboarded.
