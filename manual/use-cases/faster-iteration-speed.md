# ðŸš€ Faster Iteration Speed

Warp aims to provide 100x faster builds and tests. That's right, two orders of magnitude!

This'll make your team more cycle time - the time between coding begins and when its merged to master - a LOT faster. No more waiting for builds, tests or CI to run its checks means a lot more time is available to focus on building the right thing.

**Benchmarks available soon.** We're working on making benchmarks available to make it easy for you to see how much time could be saved with Warp!
