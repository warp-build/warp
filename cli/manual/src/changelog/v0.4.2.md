# v0.4.2: Separate Archive Cache

[You can download this release from Github](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/warp/releases/tag/v0.4.2#user-content-assets)

### 📦 Separate Archive Cache

Toolchains are now build like anything else on the build graph, but the toolchain's archives will be saved under a separate cache.

This makes it possible to both break a toolchain cache without redownloading
the archive (e.g, if we just need to rebuild it with different parameters), but
also to not accidentally assume a toolchain is built just because we have
downloaded it correctly.

Thanks @idkjs for helping find and debug this with issue #5.
