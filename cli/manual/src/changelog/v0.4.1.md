# v0.4.1: More rule actions, workspace outputs, bugfixes

[You can download this release from Github](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/warp/releases/tag/v0.4.1#user-content-assets)

### üèÉ New Rule Actions

In our test project I'm building support for the Erlang toolchain, and so new actions
are becoming necessary. So far we've had `ctx.action().exec({cmd, args, cwd})` but now you can also use

`ctx.action().copy({src, dst})` to copy a file. This action is at the moment
quite permissive and _it will overwrite the `dst`_, so use it with care. In the
future it will be restricted to only read from paths that are within the
sandbox, and only write to paths that would exist within the sandbox too and
that are also declared.

`ctx.action().writeFile({data, dst})` will let you write a file. This works
similarly to the Copy action, except that there's no source file. Instead you can use JavaScript string literals to create the contents.

For example

```javascript
const A_CONSTANT = "2112";

ctx.action().writeFile({
  data: ` My template: ${A_CONSTANT}`,
  dst,
});
```

### üóÉÔ∏è Warp Outputs

In [v0.4.0](/changelog/v0.4.0.md) I mentioned the `warp-outputs` but there was a bug where if you tried to execute Warp concurrently, the symlinking would fail.

This has been fixed now, which also helps us write more tests.
