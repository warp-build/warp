# :warp: Warp

![Main workflow](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/warp/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg)

Warp is a _simple_, _fast_, and _correct_ build system for any programming
language, that uses Deno and is built in Rust.

Learn more at [warp.build](https://warp.build).

## Features

* Fast by default. Every build action is cached and reused, and all builds are
  reproducible.
* Ships only a single executable.
* Designed to be extended. New rules and toolchains can be written quickly and
  easily in Javascript.
* Automatically manages language installations per project for you.

## Install

You can download the warp binary release from the [releases
page](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/warp/releases).
