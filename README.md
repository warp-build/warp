# :zap: Zap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AbstractMachinesLab/zap.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/AbstractMachinesLab/zap)

Zap is a _simple_, _fast_, and _correct_ build system for any programming
language, that uses Deno and is built in Rust.

Learn more at [zap.build](https://zap.build).

## Features

* Fast by default. Every build action is cached and reused, and all builds are
  reproducible.
* Ships only a single executable.
* Designed to be extended. New rules and toolchains can be written quickly and
  easily in Javascript.
* Automatically manages language installations per project for you.

## Install

You can download the zap binary release from the [releases
page](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/zap/releases).
